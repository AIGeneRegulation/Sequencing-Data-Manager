# TASK: Sequencing Data Management System

## Objective: Create a web-based application that scans, classifies, and manages sequencing data files with duplicate detection and selective deletion capabilities, all containerized with Docker.

## STEPS:
[ ] STEP 1: Design and develop the core file scanning and classification engine with duplicate detection for sequencing data formats → System STEP
[ ] STEP 2: Build the web interface with file categorization display, data overview dashboard, and interactive deletion interface → Web Development STEP  
[ ] STEP 3: Create Docker container with all dependencies and deployment configuration → System STEP
[ ] STEP 4: Test the complete system and provide usage documentation → System STEP

## Deliverable: Complete Docker-containerized web application for sequencing data management with scanning, classification, duplicate detection, and selective deletion capabilities.
